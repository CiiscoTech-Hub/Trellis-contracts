# Dead-Letter Recovery for Domain-Event Handlers

`shared::event_dead_letter` (Issue #335) gives an in-contract reaction to a
`shared::domain_events::DomainEvent` the same dead-letter discipline
`shared::jobs` already gives background work, without changing either
module.

## The gap this closes

`shared::domain_events` validates and publishes events, but has no concept
of a consumer that reacts to one in the same contract (updating an index,
a downstream side effect, cross-module notification, …). If that reaction
fails today, there are only two options: let the error propagate and abort
the whole transaction — including the event publish itself — or swallow it
silently and lose the failure. Neither is acceptable for a handler whose
failure must not block the primary action but also must not disappear.

## Design in one paragraph

`dispatch_event` runs a `DomainEventHandler` against an event. On success,
nothing is stored. On failure, instead of propagating the error, it records
an `EventDeadLetter` and returns which outcome occurred, so the caller's own
transaction can still commit. The letter carries a `shared::jobs::RetryPolicy`
captured at creation time — this module reuses that type and
`shared::jobs::is_retryable_error` directly rather than inventing a second
retry-policy type. `retry_dead_letter` is the permissionless, backoff-gated
retry path: anyone can call it once a pending letter's `next_attempt_ledger`
has passed, mirroring `shared::jobs::run_due_job`. `requeue_dead_letter` and
`discard_dead_letter` are the admin-gated recovery/rollback path for a letter
that has exhausted its retries, mirroring `shared::jobs`'s own functions of
the same name (hence the aliased crate-root re-exports —
`requeue_event_dead_letter` / `discard_event_dead_letter` — since the
unaliased names are already taken by `shared::jobs`).

## Public surface

| Item | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DomainEventHandler` | Trait a contract implements: `handle(&self, env, event) -> Result<(), Error>`. Must be idempotent — a retried letter calls `handle` again with the exact same event. |
| `dispatch_event` | Run the handler; dead-letter instead of propagating on failure. |
| `retry_dead_letter` | Permissionless, backoff-gated retry of a `Pending` letter. |
| `requeue_dead_letter` / `discard_dead_letter` | Admin-gated recovery/rollback for a `DeadLettered` letter. |
| `get_dead_letter` / `pending_dead_letter_ids` / `dead_letter_ids` | Inspection. |

## Who can do what

| Action | Required role / condition |
|---|---|
| Dispatch an event, or retry a due `Pending` letter | Anyone — permissionless, same model as `shared::jobs::run_due_job` |
| Requeue or discard a `DeadLettered` letter | `Role::Admin` (via `shared::auth::require_admin`) |
| Read a letter or list ids | Anyone (read-only) |

## Operational edge cases

| Situation | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Handler succeeds (first attempt or a retry) | `DispatchOutcome::Succeeded`; no record is kept (a retry's existing record is deleted). |
| Handler fails with a non-retryable error code, or `policy.max_attempts == 1` | Dead-lettered immediately, no retry scheduled. |
| Handler fails with a retryable error code and attempts remain | `DispatchOutcome::Retried`; `next_attempt_ledger` is set from `policy.backoff_after`. |
| `retry_dead_letter` called before `next_attempt_ledger` | `Error::ActionTooEarly` — the letter is untouched, no attempt is consumed. |
| `retry_dead_letter` called on an id that is already `DeadLettered` or does not exist | `Error::InvalidTransition` / `Error::NotFound`; dead letters must go through `requeue_dead_letter` first. |
| `requeue_dead_letter` / `discard_dead_letter` on a `Pending` letter | `Error::InvalidTransition` — only exhausted (`DeadLettered`) letters can be requeued or discarded. |
| Non-admin calls `requeue_dead_letter` / `discard_dead_letter` | `Error::Unauthorized` before the record is touched. |
| Invalid `RetryPolicy` passed to `dispatch_event` | `Error::ConfigInvalid`, the same validation `RetryPolicy::validate` already enforces for background jobs. |

## Rollback and recovery

1. **A handler bug caused a batch of letters to dead-letter.** Fix and
   redeploy the handler, then call `requeue_dead_letter` for each affected
   id (iterate `dead_letter_ids`) to give them a fresh attempt budget. The
   original event payload is preserved exactly, so replay is deterministic.
2. **A dead letter should not be retried at all** (e.g. the underlying event
   is now obsolete): call `discard_dead_letter`. The record itself is kept
   for audit — only its membership in the dead-letter index is cleared —
   mirroring `shared::jobs::discard_dead_letter`.
3. **A dependency the handler needs was degraded and is now healthy again**,
   and letters are still inside their backoff window: there is no need to
   wait them out — `requeue_dead_letter` resets `next_attempt_ledger` to
   "now" immediately.
4. **A bad `RetryPolicy` was used.** `dispatch_event` takes the policy per
   call rather than reading global, persistent configuration, so correcting
   it only affects events dispatched after the fix; already-stored letters
   keep the policy they were created with, exactly like
   `shared::jobs::Job.policy`.

## Compatibility

Purely additive: new storage keys, no changes to `shared::domain_events`,
`shared::jobs`, or any contract interface. A contract adopts it by calling
`dispatch_event` after (or instead of) directly invoking its own handler
logic for a published event; nothing changes until that call is wired in.

## Operator tooling (Issue #267)

### Library additions

| Item | Purpose | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| `list_event_dead_letters(env, status, due_by, offset, limit)` | One page of `Pending` or `DeadLettered` letters. `due_by: Some(ledger)` keeps only letters `retry_dead_letter` would accept at that ledger. | At most the `evt_dlq` scan limit of record reads (`shared::scan_guard`), so the cost is bounded regardless of queue size |
| `event_dead_letter_summary(env)` | `pending`, `dead_lettered`, `total_created` | Two index reads and one instance read |
| `requeue_dead_letters(env, admin, ids, now)` | Admin bulk requeue after a handler fix; returns a `shared::batch::BatchResult` with one outcome per id | ≤ `MAX_REQUEUE_BATCH` (25) record writes, and each index written once |

### Forwarding entry points

The tool drives a contract that exposes:

```rust
pub fn dlq_summary(env: Env) -> EventDeadLetterSummary {
    event_dead_letter::event_dead_letter_summary(&env)
}
pub fn dlq_list(env: Env, status: EventDispatchStatus, due_by: Option<u32>,
                offset: u32, limit: u32) -> EventDeadLetterPage {
    event_dead_letter::list_event_dead_letters(&env, status, due_by, offset, limit)
}
pub fn dlq_get(env: Env, id: u64) -> Option<EventDeadLetter> {
    event_dead_letter::get_dead_letter(&env, id)
}
pub fn dlq_retry(env: Env, id: u64) -> Result<DispatchOutcome, Error> {
    let now = env.ledger().sequence();
    event_dead_letter::retry_dead_letter(&env, id, now, &MyHandler)
}
pub fn dlq_requeue(env: Env, admin: Address, ids: Vec<u64>) -> Result<BatchResult, Error> {
    let now = env.ledger().sequence();
    event_dead_letter::requeue_dead_letters(&env, &admin, &ids, now)
}
pub fn dlq_discard(env: Env, admin: Address, id: u64) -> Result<EventDeadLetter, Error> {
    event_dead_letter::discard_dead_letter(&env, &admin, id)
}
```

### `scripts/dead-letter-ops.cjs`

```bash
export DLQ_CONTRACT_ID=C...   # contract exposing dlq_*
export DLQ_SOURCE=operator    # stellar CLI identity
node scripts/dead-letter-ops.cjs summary
node scripts/dead-letter-ops.cjs list --status DeadLettered --limit 20
node scripts/dead-letter-ops.cjs list --status Pending --due
node scripts/dead-letter-ops.cjs show 42
node scripts/dead-letter-ops.cjs retry 42
node scripts/dead-letter-ops.cjs retry-due --max 25
node scripts/dead-letter-ops.cjs requeue 42 43 44 --admin G...  --source admin
node scripts/dead-letter-ops.cjs discard 42 --admin G... --source admin
node scripts/dead-letter-ops.cjs requeue 42 --admin G... --dry-run
```

Reads are simulated with `--send no` and never submit a transaction.
`retry-due` reads the latest ledger with `stellar ledger latest`, collects
the due ids before retrying (each success removes its id from the `Pending`
index), and sends one transaction per letter, so one bad letter cannot block
the rest. `--dry-run` prints the exact CLI calls, which is useful for
reviewing admin transactions before they are sent.

### Edge cases

| Situation | Behavior |
|---|---|
| A bulk requeue includes an id that is missing, or not `DeadLettered` (e.g. already `Pending`, or listed twice) | `Failure(code)` for that id (`NotFound` = 2, `InvalidTransition` = 950); the other ids still go through |
| More than 25 ids | `QuotaExceeded`; the tool sends chunks of 25 |
| Empty id list | `InvalidArgument` |
| Non-admin requeue | `Unauthorized`, before anything is read |
| A letter becomes due, or resolves, between `list` and `retry` | The retry returns `ActionTooEarly`, or `NotFound` because the record is deleted once resolved; nothing changes, and `retry-due` reports it and continues |
| The index outgrows the scan limit | The page stops early with `has_more: true`; continue from `next_offset`. Tighten the limit with `scan_guard::set_scan_limit(env, admin, EVENT_DLQ_TOPIC, n)` |

### Runbook

1. `summary` → `list --status DeadLettered` → `show <id>`; read
   `last_error` against `docs/ERRORS.md`.
2. Fix and redeploy the handler (handlers must stay idempotent).
3. `requeue <ids…> --admin …` gives each letter a fresh attempt budget.
4. `retry-due` replays them immediately. A letter that fails again follows
   its stored `RetryPolicy` back to `Pending` or `DeadLettered`.
5. A letter that must never run again is `discard`ed. The record stays for
   audit.

Rollback: requeue never touches the event payload or policy. Undoing it
means letting the letter exhaust its retries again, or discarding it.

```bash
cargo test -p shared event_dead_letter
node scripts/dead-letter-ops.cjs requeue 1 2 --admin GADMIN --contract CDLQ --dry-run
```
