# Contract-Level Asset Conservation Invariant Proofs & Formal Verification

/* Authorized Protocol Quality Assurance & Formal Verification Test Suite */

## 1. Executive Summary & Purpose

The **Trellis Contracts** suite manages financial value, humanitarian aid disbursements, escrow commitments, and protocol reserves on the Stellar/Soroban ledger. To provide mathematical assurance against unauthorized asset creation, loss, or misallocation, this framework implements **contract-level invariant proofs** that verify state conservation before and after every supported transition.

This document describes:
- The formal mathematical conservation model.
- The state transition matrix across financial contracts (`payments-contract`, `aid-contract`, `treasury-contract`).
- Invariant assertions on success, failure, and reversion paths.
- Negative testing via fixture mutations that prove tests fail when impossible balances occur.
- Assumptions, operational bounds, and known exclusions.

## 2. Formal Mathematical Conservation Model

### 2.1 The Closed Token System

For any token asset contract $\mathcal{T}$, let:
- $\mathcal{U} = \{ u_1, u_2, \dots, u_n \}$ be the set of all external participants (donors, beneficiaries, managers, fee recipients).
- $\mathcal{C}$ be the Trellis smart contract address.
- $B(x, t)$ denote the on-chain token balance of address $x$ at discrete ledger state $t$.
- $L(\mathcal{C}, t)$ denote the sum of all internal liability obligations recorded in contract storage at state $t$.

### 2.2 Global Conservation Invariant (Axiom I)

Across any state transition $\tau: t \to t+1$:
$$\sum_{u \in \mathcal{U}} B(u, t+1) + B(\mathcal{C}, t+1) = \sum_{u \in \mathcal{U}} B(u, t) + B(\mathcal{C}, t)$$

Equivalently, the net change in total system assets is strictly zero:
$$\Delta S = \Delta B_{\text{external}} + \Delta B_{\text{contract}} = 0$$

No tokens are spontaneously generated from thin air, destroyed, or lost to inaccessible storage keys.

### 2.3 Solvency & Backing Equivalence Invariant (Axiom II)

The contract's physical token balance held in the Stellar Asset Contract (SAC) must strictly match or exceed all internal accounting commitments:
$$B(\mathcal{C}, t) \ge L(\mathcal{C}, t)$$

Under strict conservation (where no untracked surplus is retained):
$$B(\mathcal{C}, t) = L(\mathcal{C}, t)$$

Where $L(\mathcal{C}, t)$ is defined per contract:
- **`payments-contract`**: $L = \text{total\_deposits} + \sum_{e \in \text{ActiveEscrows}} \text{amount}(e)$.
- **`aid-contract`**: $L = \sum_{a \in \text{PendingAids}} \text{amount}(a)$.
- **`treasury-contract`**: $L = \sum_{c \in \text{Categories}} \text{category\_balance}(c)$.

### 2.4 Reversion Invariance (Axiom III)

For any transition $\tau$ that encounters an invalid argument, unauthorized caller, expired deadline, or insufficient funds:
$$B(x, t+1) = B(x, t) \quad \forall x \in \mathcal{U} \cup \{ \mathcal{C} \}$$
$$L(\mathcal{C}, t+1) = L(\mathcal{C}, t)$$

Rejected transactions guarantee zero side effects and zero balance drift.

## 4. Fixture Mutation & Invariant Sensitivity Testing

To guarantee that the invariant test engine is sensitive and does not produce false negatives, explicit **mutation tests** inject corrupted state:

1. **Unbacked Reserve Inflation**: Simulates impossible asset creation where contract reserve increases without an external debit.
   - **Expected Error**: `InvariantViolation::AssetConservationViolated { net_delta > 0 }`.
2. **Unauthorized Reserve Drainage**: Simulates asset leakage where contract balance decreases without a legitimate withdrawal.
   - **Expected Error**: `InvariantViolation::AssetConservationViolated { net_delta < 0 }`.
3. **Internal Liability Desynchronization**: Simulates internal ledger corruption where liabilities exceed physical reserves.
   - **Expected Error**: `InvariantViolation::SolvencyBackingMismatched`.
4. **Negative Balance Corruption**: Simulates integer underflow or invalid balance states.
   - **Expected Error**: `InvariantViolation::ImpossibleBalanceDetected`.

## 5. Assumptions & Known Exclusions

### 5.1 Protocol Assumptions
- **Standard SAC Semantics**: The underlying token contracts implement standard Stellar Asset Contract semantics where transfer amounts are deterministic and 1:1.
- **Atomic Execution**: Soroban host environment guarantees atomic execution; cross-contract invocation failures revert all associated state changes.
- **Time/Sequence Monotonicity**: Expiry windows rely on monotonic ledger sequence numbers and timestamps (`env.ledger().sequence()`, `env.ledger().timestamp()`).

### 5.2 Known Exclusions
- **Rebasing & Fee-on-Transfer Tokens**: Tokens that algorithmically alter balances in holder accounts outside standard `transfer` calls (e.g., elastic supply rebasing tokens) violate the constant-sum assumption and are **not supported**.
- **Admin Minting / Burning Outside Contracts**: Token administrators minting directly to contract addresses or burning tokens via SAC administrator keys outside the contract's methods will alter reserves and require balance resynchronization.

## 7. Runtime Transition Checks in the Aid Contract (Issue #266)

The suites above check invariants from outside, after a call. The aid
contract now also enforces them inside every balance, ownership, and
entitlement transition
([`contracts/aid-contract/src/transitions.rs`](../contracts/aid-contract/src/transitions.rs)),
so a violating call is rejected and rolled back instead of only being
detected later.

| Invariant | Check | Paths |
|---|---|---|
| Balance (Axiom II) | `escrow_in`: the contract's token balance must rise by exactly the recorded amount, otherwise `InvariantViolation` (118) | `create_aid`, `batch_create_aid`, `create_milestone_aid` |
| Ownership | `commit`: donor, recipient, token, amount, and tranche count are immutable | every status change |
| Lifecycle | `commit`: `Settled` and `Refunded` are terminal; status only moves forward | every status change |
| Entitlement | `settle_milestones`: tranches must sum to the escrowed amount; status is derived from what is still unclaimed | `claim_aid_milestone`, `refund_milestone_aid` |

### Defects closed

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| `claim_aid` on a milestone program paid out the whole escrow without inspector verification, after which the tranches could be claimed again, draining other records' escrow | `InvalidArgument`; tranches are claimed only through `claim_aid_milestone` |
| `refund_aid` on a milestone program refunded the full amount, including tranches already paid | `InvalidArgument`; use `refund_milestone_aid` |
| `claim_aid_milestone` never changed the record's status | `PartiallyClaimed` while tranches remain, `Settled` when none remain |
| `refund_milestone_aid` left verified-but-unclaimed tranches in the contract forever (claims close at expiry) | Every unclaimed tranche is refunded; a fully claimed program returns `AlreadyClaimed` |
| `delete_aid` could delete a partially claimed record that still held escrow | `CannotDeletePending` |
| A fee-on-transfer token under-backed new liabilities (§5.2) | Rejected at escrow time with `InvariantViolation` |

**Migration.** No storage migration is needed. Milestone records created
before this change still read `Pending`; their status is recomputed from the
stored tranches on the next claim or refund.

**Recovery.** A rejected transition writes nothing, so the caller retries
once the precondition holds; for example, an unverified tranche can be
claimed after an inspector verifies it. If `InvariantViolation` comes from
`settle_milestones`, stored tranches disagree with the record: pause the
contract and reconcile the record against token balances before resuming.

```bash
cargo test -p aid-contract transitions
```
