//! Tamper-evident chronological ledger for privileged and financial events (Issue #233).
//!
//! Soroban already emits events, but emitted events are not individually
//! verifiable: an indexer that receives them cannot prove that one was not
//! inserted, removed, reordered, or edited before it reached them, and the
//! contract itself keeps no ordered record it can re-derive later. This module
//! adds an **append-only, hash-chained ledger** for the events that matter most
//! to an auditor — role/admin changes, configuration changes, upgrades, pauses
//! and every movement of value — plus a bounded, verifiable export.
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! | Property | Mechanism |
//! |---|---|
//! | Chronological | `seq` is strictly `previous + 1`; ledger sequence and timestamp must be non-decreasing. |
//! | Tamper-evident | `hash = sha256(domain ‖ schema ‖ seq ‖ event fields ‖ prev_hash)`; any edit changes every later hash. |
//! | Append-only | Entries are only ever written for `seq = length + 1`; there is no update or delete API. |
//! | Verifiable | [`verify_chain`] re-derives the full chain from storage and compares it with the stored head. |
//! | Exportable | [`export_ledger`] returns a bounded, versioned bundle whose entries and digest can be checked off-chain with [`verify_export`]. |
//! | Compatible | Purely additive: new storage keys, no changes to existing event topics, records, or entry points. |
//!
//! ## Hash definition
//!
//! Every field of [`AuditLedgerEntry`] except `hash` participates in the digest,
//! in a fixed order, encoded with the Soroban canonical `Val` XDR form
//! (`ToXdr`). The domain separator [`AUDIT_DOMAIN`] and
//! [`AUDIT_LEDGER_SCHEMA_VERSION`] are mixed in first so an audit hash can never
//! collide with a hash produced by another subsystem or a future schema.
//!
//! ```text
//! hash(n) = sha256( xdr([
//!     "trellis_audit_ledger", schema_version,
//!     seq, class, kind, module, actor, subject, resource, attribute,
//!     amount, previous_amount, note, correlation_id,
//!     ledger, timestamp, prev_hash
//! ]) )
//! ```
//!
//! `prev_hash` for the first entry is the all-zero [`genesis_hash`].
//!
//! ## Failure model
//!
//! [`verify_chain`] reports the **first** failure and its sequence number rather
//! than returning a bare boolean, so an operator can decide how much prefix is
//! trustworthy. See `docs/AUDIT_LEDGER.md` for the runbook: what each failure
//! means, how to bound the blast radius, and how to recover.
//!
//! ## Operational limits
//!
//! - Verification is bounded to [`MAX_VERIFY_ENTRIES`] entries per call. An
//!   oversized ledger returns [`AuditVerificationFailure::ScanLimitExceeded`]
//!   instead of running unbounded work.
//! - Exports are paged: at most [`MAX_EXPORT_LIMIT`] entries per bundle, with a
//!   `from_seq` cursor and `has_more` flag.
//! - Entry storage uses persistent storage with the workspace TTL policy; the
//!   head uses instance storage because it is contract-level configuration.
//!
//! ## Compatibility
//!
//! This module is opt-in. Contracts adopt it by calling [`append_event`] on the
//! privileged/financial paths they already audit. Nothing in the existing
//! `shared::events`, `shared::timeline`, or contract interfaces is changed.
//!
//! ## Duplicate detection and merge review
//!
//! The ledger also backs a deterministic duplicate-detection and merge-review
//! workflow for records that may be entered more than once (aid records,
//! referrals, marketplace listings, oracle feeds).
//!
//! - [`candidate_fingerprint`] derives a stable 32-byte fingerprint from the
//!   identifying fields of a candidate. It is a pure function of its inputs, so
//!   two callers observing the same record always compute the same fingerprint.
//! - [`detect_duplicates`] scans the ledger for entries whose fingerprint
//!   matches, returning matches in ascending `seq` order. The scan is bounded by
//!   [`MAX_VERIFY_ENTRIES`] and is therefore reproducible.
//! - [`propose_merge`] records a reviewable merge proposal as an audited
//!   [`AuditEventKind::PrivilegedAction`] entry. Proposals are never applied
//!   automatically; a privileged actor must call [`approve_merge`] or
//!   [`reject_merge`].
//! - [`approve_merge`] marks a proposal approved and appends an audit entry.
//!   Approval is reversible via [`revert_merge`] while the proposal is still
//!   within the revert window, and every transition is audited.
//!
//! All merge state lives under new storage keys, so existing public APIs,
//! schemas, and user-facing behavior are unchanged.
