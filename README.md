# Overview

The **Trellis Contracts** repository contains every on-chain component responsible for securely executing humanitarian aid transactions on the Stellar blockchain using **Soroban**.

These contracts serve as the trust layer of the platform.

Instead of relying on centralized intermediaries, every payment, verification, referral reward, and settlement is executed transparently on-chain.

The contracts are designed to be:

- Secure
- Auditable
- Upgradeable
- Gas Efficient
- Modular
- Production Ready

---

# Why Smart Contracts?

Traditional donation systems rely heavily on centralized infrastructure.

Trellis replaces this model by executing critical operations directly on-chain.

The contracts provide:

- Transparent aid settlements
- Immutable transaction records
- Referral commission distribution
- Treasury management
- Multi-signature administration
- Emergency controls
- Upgrade governance

Every important financial action becomes publicly verifiable.

### Deploying Contracts

To deploy all contracts to testnet:

```bash
./scripts/verify.sh testnet
```

For mainnet deployments, see [UPGRADEABILITY.md](./UPGRADEABILITY.md) for the full upgrade governance process.

### Upgrade History

All upgrades are tracked in the on-chain upgradeability registry. To view upgrade history for a contract:

```bash
soroban contract invoke \
  --id <UPGRADEABILITY_CONTRACT_ID> \
  -- get_upgrade_history \
  --contract-id <CONTRACT_ID>
```

#### Permission-aware discovery search

`search_aids(viewer, cursor, limit)` returns only pending, visible records for

address granted access by the donor. Completed, hidden, and deleted records
are removed from the derived search index. Administrators can run
`repair_search_index(admin)` to rebuild that index from canonical aid storage;
the return value reports indexed, added, and removed entries. No migration is
required: older records are included on the next repair run.

# Documentation

This repository contains comprehensive documentation for contract design, gas optimization, security practices, and testing infrastructure.

## Core Documentation

- [**UPGRADEABILITY.md**](UPGRADEABILITY.md) — System-wide upgrade registry and safe contract upgrade patterns with migration hooks and pre/post-upgrade validation.
- [**GAS_OPTIMIZATION.md**](GAS_OPTIMIZATION.md) — Gas optimization principles, applied optimizations, benchmark infrastructure, and a checklist for new features.
- [**SECURITY_BATCH.md**](SECURITY_BATCH.md) — Security analysis of batch operations including reentrancy protection, input validation, and failure semantics.
- [**docs/IMPORT_PIPELINE.md**](docs/IMPORT_PIPELINE.md) — Bulk import pipeline with pre-flight dry-run validation, duplicate detection, and prescriptive rollback guidance.
- [**docs/PREFLIGHT.md**](docs/PREFLIGHT.md) — Deterministic pre-submission preflight for high-risk operations with ready/warning/blocked verdicts, remediation steps, and shared error mapping.
- [**docs/AUDIT_LEDGER.md**](docs/AUDIT_LEDGER.md) — Append-only hash-chained ledger for privileged and financial events: hashing definition, verification and export APIs, failure-mode table, and rollback/recovery runbook.
- [**docs/STATE_SNAPSHOT_EXPORT.md**](docs/STATE_SNAPSHOT_EXPORT.md) — Signed, hash-chained state snapshot export for audit and debugging: Ed25519 signer registry, chain verification, bounded export/verify, and rollback/recovery runbook.
- [**docs/DEPENDENCY_HEALTH_GUARD.md**](docs/DEPENDENCY_HEALTH_GUARD.md) — Authorized dependency health-check reporting and a retry/circuit-breaker budget around degraded-mode fallback execution, closing the open-write and unbounded-retry gaps in `shared::health`/`shared::degradation`.
- [**docs/EVENT_DEAD_LETTER.md**](docs/EVENT_DEAD_LETTER.md) — Dead-letter recovery for failed domain-event handlers: dispatch-and-capture instead of propagating, permissionless backoff retry, and admin-gated requeue/discard reusing `shared::jobs::RetryPolicy`.
- [**docs/CLIENT_REQUEST_VALIDATION.md**](docs/CLIENT_REQUEST_VALIDATION.md) — Cross-repo client request validation: schema-version compatibility, field/semantic checks reusing `shared::semantic`, caller-identity authorization, and an idempotent retry wrapper around `shared::idempotency`.
- [**docs/INIT_ROLLBACK.md**](docs/INIT_ROLLBACK.md) — Rollback verification for failed multi-step/cross-contract initialization: tracked steps mirroring `shared::recovery`, operator-probe verification (the inverse of `shared::release_readiness::verify_initialized_addresses`), and a hard gate so a tracker can only reach `RolledBack` with a passing verification.
- [**docs/SCAN_GUARD.md**](docs/SCAN_GUARD.md) — Bounded iteration protection for storage scans: closes `shared::pagination`'s unbounded `max_scan` input with a hard ceiling, admin-configurable per-scope limits, a fail-fast budget check, and a generic capped offset scan for ad-hoc id lists.
- [**docs/BATCH_PARTIAL_FAILURE.md**](docs/BATCH_PARTIAL_FAILURE.md) — Batch partial-failure reporting and retry on top of `shared::batch`: an addressable per-recipient failure report with retryable classification, and a forced-non-atomic retry of just the retryable entries, authorized to the original caller or an admin.
- [**docs/ON_CHAIN_PROTOCOL_CHANGELOG.md**](docs/ON_CHAIN_PROTOCOL_CHANGELOG.md) — On-chain, queryable complement to `changelog/entries.json`: immutable append-only entries using the same impact/summary/migration-notes shape, the breaking-needs-migration-notes rule enforced on-chain, and bounded listing/existence queries via `shared::scan_guard`.

## Module Documentation

- [**shared/README.md**](shared/README.md) — Shared contract library with error codes, reserved ranges, and event schemas used across all contracts.
- [**testing/README.md**](testing/README.md) — Comprehensive testing framework with mocks, helpers, simulation tools, fuzzing harnesses, and examples.
- [**security/README.md**](security/README.md) — Security audit tooling, CI gating, and allowlist management for static analysis and vulnerability scanning.
