## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `shared::storage_version`: next-version migration compatibility checks — read-only `check_schema_migration` preflight classifying a `MigrationPlan` against the stored schema version (single-version hops only, target must be readable by the running build, no in-progress journal), and admin-gated, idempotent `commit_schema_migration` that stamps the new version only after a `Completed` journal for exactly that plan (#262); see `docs/MIGRATION_SAFETY.md`
- `shared::degraded_mode`: user-safe degraded mode at the entry point — `guard_operation` admits `Entry` operations only on the primary or a fund-safe fallback path, never blocks `Exit` operations, and keeps `Read` operations available flagged as read-only, all before any write (#265); see `docs/EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCY_DEGRADATION_MATRIX.md`
- Runtime balance, ownership, and entitlement transition checks in `contracts/aid-contract` (`transitions.rs`): escrow inflows must raise the contract balance by exactly the recorded amount, record identity is immutable, lifecycle is forward-only, and milestone tranches must sum to the escrowed total (#266); see `docs/ASSET_CONSERVATION_INVARIANTS.md`
- `shared::event_dead_letter` operator tooling — bounded `list_event_dead_letters` (status and due-ledger filters), `event_dead_letter_summary`, and admin bulk `requeue_dead_letters` with per-id outcomes, driven by `scripts/dead-letter-ops.cjs` (#267); see `docs/EVENT_DEAD_LETTER.md`
- `shared::protocol_changelog`: On-chain, queryable complement to `changelog/entries.json` — `record_protocol_change` (admin-gated) enforces the same breaking-needs-migration-notes rule `changelog/schema.json` enforces off-chain, entries are immutable/append-only with a `supersedes` correction path like `shared::audit_ledger`, and `list_protocol_changes_since`/`has_breaking_change_since` are bounded via `shared::scan_guard` (#340); see `docs/ON_CHAIN_PROTOCOL_CHANGELOG.md`
- `shared::batch_retry`: Batch partial-failure reporting and retry on top of `shared::batch` — `record_batch_failures` persists an addressable per-recipient `BatchFailureReport` (retryable classification reusing `shared::jobs::is_retryable_error`, corrected for `BatchError` codes), `retry_batch_failures` resubmits only the retryable entries as a forced non-atomic batch (authorized to the original caller or an admin), and `discard_batch_failure_report` is the admin-gated cleanup path (#339); see `docs/BATCH_PARTIAL_FAILURE.md`
- `shared::scan_guard`: Bounded iteration protection for storage scans — `clamp_scan_limit`/`ensure_within_scan_budget` give `shared::pagination`'s caller-supplied `max_scan` a hard ceiling it previously lacked, `get_effective_scan_limit`/`set_scan_limit` add an admin-configurable per-scope limit that is always clamped to `ABSOLUTE_MAX_SCAN`, and `bounded_offset_scan` is a generic, hard-capped, resumable offset scan for ad-hoc id lists outside `shared::pagination`'s sorted-keyset model (#338); see `docs/SCAN_GUARD.md`
- `shared::init_rollback`: Rollback verification for failed multi-step/cross-contract initialization — `begin_initialization`/`complete_init_step`/`fail_init_step` track an ordered deployment sequence, `verify_rollback` checks operator-supplied probes against the steps that ran (the inverse of `verify_initialized_addresses`), and `complete_rollback` is the only, verification-gated path to a `RolledBack` state, after which `begin_initialization` serves as the retry path (#337); see `docs/INIT_ROLLBACK.md`
- `shared::client_validation`: Request validation for cross-repo Trellis clients — schema-version compatibility gate, field/semantic checks reusing `shared::semantic`, caller-identity authorization (donor/depositor/seller must match the authenticated caller), and a generic `fingerprint_request` plus `begin_idempotent_request`/`complete_idempotent_request` retry wrapper around `shared::idempotency` (#336); see `docs/CLIENT_REQUEST_VALIDATION.md`
- `shared::event_dead_letter`: Dead-letter recovery for failed domain-event handlers — `dispatch_event` captures a handler failure instead of propagating it, `retry_dead_letter` is a permissionless backoff-gated retry of a due letter, and `requeue_dead_letter`/`discard_dead_letter` are the admin-gated recovery/rollback path for an exhausted letter; reuses `shared::jobs::RetryPolicy` and `is_retryable_error` directly (#335); see `docs/EVENT_DEAD_LETTER.md`
- `shared::health_guard`: Authorized dependency health-check reporting and a retry/circuit-breaker budget around degraded-mode fallback execution — admin-managed reporter registry gating `shared::degradation::record_dependency_check`, and `execute_guarded` (wrapping `execute_with_fallback`) that trips `DegradationError::CircuitBreakerOpen` after a configurable number of fallback attempts inside a rolling window, with admin reset and half-open cooldown recovery (#334); see `docs/DEPENDENCY_HEALTH_GUARD.md`
- `shared::snapshot`: Signed, hash-chained state snapshot export for audit and debugging — admin-managed Ed25519 signer registry, per-module chained `capture_snapshot`, full on-chain `verify_chain` re-derivation, and a bounded, storage-free-verifiable `export_snapshots`/`verify_export` bundle (#301); see `docs/STATE_SNAPSHOT_EXPORT.md`
- `shared::workflow_correlation`: shared correlation-ID policy for multi-contract workflows (1–64 bytes of ASCII letters, digits, `-`, `_`) with a chain check that requires every step of a workflow to carry the same ID; retries reuse the ID (#330); see `docs/WORKFLOW_CORRELATION.md`
- `shared::migration::dry_run_cross_contract`: preview a migration across several contracts in one batch, reporting batch validity, totals across valid plans, approval requirements, and duplicate contracts, before any write (#332); see `docs/MIGRATION_SAFETY.md`
- `shared::release_readiness::verify_initialized_addresses`: smoke-test gate check that fails when any initialized address is unset or the list is empty (#331); see `docs/RELEASE_READINESS.md`
- Permission matrix tests for `contracts/access-control` covering every privileged entrypoint with an unauthorized caller, asserting `NotAdmin`, `RoleEscalation`, or `Unauthorized` and that refused calls leave state unchanged (#333)
- `shared::policy_preview`: Policy simulation preview framework for previewing affected records and users, expected operational side effects, and rollback constraints before committing irreversible or high-impact changes across Treasury, Aid, Referral, Governance, Oracle, and Marketplace modules (#250); see `docs/POLICY_SIMULATION_PREVIEW.md`
- `shared::degradation`: External dependency degradation matrix with failure mode classification, tiered degradation levels (`Nominal`, `DegradedMinor`, `DegradedMajor`, `CriticalFailure`), user-safe fallback behavior (`FallbackStrategy`, `FallbackDecision`), automated checks, and recovery receipts across Treasury, Aid, Referral, Governance, Oracle, and Marketplace modules (#231); see `docs/EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCY_DEGRADATION_MATRIX.md`
- `shared::export`: Permission-aware export pipeline with bounded memory chunking, in-flight cancellation, multi-module role authorization (Treasury, Aid, Referral, Governance, Oracle, Marketplace), forbidden field purging, and cumulative SHA-256 stream digests; see `docs/EXPORT_PIPELINE.md`
- `shared::audit_ledger`: an append-only, hash-chained ledger for privileged and financial events (roles, config, upgrades, pause/unpause, treasury/aid/escrow/referral/governance/oracle/marketplace value movement) with on-chain `verify_chain`, permissioned bounded `export_ledger`, storage-free `verify_export`, a publishable head-checkpoint event, and tamper-detection tests (#233); see `docs/AUDIT_LEDGER.md`
- `shared::operational_metadata`: Data minimization review and retention enforcement for operational metadata across Treasury, Aid, Referral, Governance, Oracle, and Marketplace modules with classification, redundant field pruning, two-phase testable deletion, hold management, and migration adapters (#229); see `docs/OPERATIONAL_METADATA_RETENTION.md`
- Two-step ownership transfer with pending acceptance and expiry in `shared::auth` and `contracts/access-control`, requiring explicit cryptographic acceptance by the target owner, supporting automatic expiry rejection, and allowing cancellation before acceptance (#150); see `docs/ACCESS_CONTROL.md`
- `shared::lifecycle_events`: a canonical, versioned event envelope (`("lifecycle", resource, transition)` with schema version, resource ID, from/to state, actor, and timestamp) for every lifecycle transition, plus an ordered-sequence assertion harness (`testing::lifecycle_events`) that fails tests when an expected event is missing or reordered (#144); see `docs/LIFECYCLE_EVENTS.md`
- `shared::disclosure`: progressive disclosure of transaction detail fields, where a `Critical`-severity field can never end up reachable only through the advanced/expanded view (#125)
- Machine-readable changelog (`changelog/entries.json` + `changelog/schema.json`) for protocol-facing changes, validated in CI (#126); see `docs/CHANGELOG_SCHEMA.md`
- Fault-injection test suite (`testing/src/fault_injection.rs`) exercising the sandbox's fake oracle/token/RPC adapters for hard failures, staleness, insufficient balance, and submission timeouts, proving each fails actionably with no partial state (#127)
- PR checklist enforcement (`scripts/check-pr-checklist.cjs`, new `release-readiness.yml` workflow) so an incomplete `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` checklist fails CI instead of only reviewer attention; documented in `docs/RELEASE_READINESS.md` (#128)
- Cross-contract integration test suite covering full aid lifecycle, expiry flows, authorization boundaries, partial failure recovery, and referral commission distribution
- WASM size budget check in CI with per-contract limits and PR comments showing size deltas
- Automated API documentation publishing to GitHub Pages on every merge to main
- Improved crate-level rustdoc for all core contracts (aid, treasury, referral, oracle, registry)
- Landing page for API documentation explaining contract relationships and navigation

### Changed
- Enhanced rustdoc crate-level documentation with usage examples and cross-references
- Updated CI workflow to include WASM size measurement step

### Fixed
- Restored `shared/src/lib.rs`, which was truncated mid-file with a malformed `no_std` attribute, invalid module declarations, and duplicate re-exports, so the `shared` crate (and everything depending on it) could not compile. The module list and re-exports were reconstructed from the last intact revision plus the newer `release_readiness` module, and several latent compile errors in `shared` (over-long `symbol_short!` values, unencodable `Option<user-defined type>` contract fields, missing imports, duplicate `ensure_supported_version`/`is_supported_version` re-exports) were corrected without changing public behavior.
- `shared`'s `health`, `reconciliation`, and `telemetry` modules were re-exported (`pub use health::{...}` etc.) without a matching `mod` declaration in `shared/src/lib.rs` — an unresolved-module compile error for the whole workspace. Added the three missing `pub mod` declarations.
- `contracts/aid-contract` milestone programs (#266): `claim_aid` no longer pays out a milestone program's full escrow without inspector verification (which also let the tranches be claimed again from other records' escrow), and `refund_aid` no longer refunds already-paid tranches; both return `InvalidArgument` for milestone programs. `claim_aid_milestone` now records `PartiallyClaimed`/`Settled`, `refund_milestone_aid` returns every unclaimed tranche instead of stranding verified ones, and `delete_aid` refuses partially claimed records.

## Versioning Strategy

The Trellis Contracts project uses a hybrid versioning approach:

### Repository Version
- Follows Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Incremented when contract suite interfaces or behaviors change significantly
- Used for releases and documentation

### Individual Contract Versions
- Each contract tracks its own version in the upgradeability registry
- Allows independent contract updates without forcing suite-wide version bumps
- Critical for the on-chain upgrade system where contract identity is preserved across versions

See [UPGRADEABILITY.md](./UPGRADEABILITY.md) for details on the on-chain upgrade registry and version tracking.
